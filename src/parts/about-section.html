                        My name is Denise Claridy. I help busy real estate agents so they can focus on their clients and show properties.

                      <p class="lead">
                        After enjoying over 30 years working in various roles in the financial services and 
                        information technology industry, the company where I worked closed its doors. While 
                        pondering my next act, I was approached by a busy, high producing realtor that needed a 
                        transaction coordinator. The rest is history. Evandy InfoSolutions was born.

                      <p class="lead">
                        I am now a seasoned real estate support professional that provides virtual contract-to-close 
                        services, listing services, marketing support and technology services to real estate agents 
                        in MA, CT and FL.
